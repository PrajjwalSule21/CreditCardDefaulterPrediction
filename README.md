# Credit Card Default Prediction

Credit Card Default Prediction is an Machine Learning based project which is able to predict the credit card payment defaulters with the help of input data.

# Problem Statement

Most of the time credit card company faces some issue regarding the payment, there are such customer who are not willing to pay their credit card bills on time.

### AIM : 
To make a solution which is able to predit the behaviour of a customer with the help of their past data, so that companies will aware about that kind of customers.

### Goal :

Use Machine Learning to make this solution as well with the help of Data Analysis (EDA) understand the data and customers past behaviour, and once when we found solution then deploy that solution as Web-App.

## Approch

- Get the data from resource.
- Understand the data (in general).
- Perform some EDA to understand the cusomters behaviour.
- Preprocess the data.
- Do Feature Engineering and Feature Selection. 
- Make Different-Different model according the behaviour of data.
- Get the best model and tune that model.
- Deploy that model as Web-App


## Tech Stack

- **Python**  - as a technology, which is back support of all things like Python gives the support to all the operations.
- **EDA**     - for Data Analysis, so that we can understand the data in better way.
- **Machine Learning** -  to make a different-different models on the data.
- **Streamlit** - for making a Web-App.
- **Heeroku** - for deploying that solution so, that anyone can use the solution easily.

## Steps

- Get the `Raw Data` from directory.
- `Raw Data Feature Classification` to seprate the different types of features present in data.
- `Raw Data Validation` to validate the raw data.
- `Raw Data Preprocessing` to preprocess the raw data for further use.
- `Featrue Selection` to select the important features for model.
- `Feature Engineering` to scaling the data and split that data for model.
- `Preprocessing`, `Feature Engineering` and `Feature Selection` all these things done with the help of `EDA`
- `Model Building` to build and select the best model.
- Use `Logger` to log every activity.
- `Notebook` which contains entire basic flow of project.
- `app.py` make an Web-App and deploy the app on Heroku.

## Future Scope

- Use multiple Algorithms.
- Do more data crunching
- Optimize app.py
- Work on Front-End
## How to use this on Local

- Create virtual environment 
- intall requiremnets.txt
- run app.py
